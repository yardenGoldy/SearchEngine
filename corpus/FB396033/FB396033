<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Suman, chairman of the </F>
parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, by Jaroslav 
Spurny; place and date not given: "I Am Nobody's Friend"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Spurny] Your committee 
and, subsequently, parliament will have to approve the report on 
the security of the state. How do you see security? 
  [Suman] Every state promotes, by means of the government, 
its interests abroad and tries to do what it can to limit what 
we call security risks. Today, however, neither the government 
nor the parliament has the material on which it could assess the 
external and internal security risks of the Czech Republic. 
  Such material is simply indispensable and should specify the 
priorities of the risks mentioned in it. We must decide which 
of them to cover by repression, which by legislative measures, 
and which by organizational steps, and which threaten us in the 
foreseeable future, and so forth. Precisely the fact that no 
such material exists makes it possible for our representatives 
to issue different statements on foreign policy. I believe some 
people are not interested in prioritizing our interests because 
that enables them to present their own personal opinions. I 
believe this to be contrary to the interest of the Czech 
Republic. 
  Regarding the report that is to be prepared, it was 
requested 
by the deputies and is a reaction of the Chamber to the fall 
report by Minister Ruml, which, however, did not report on the 
overall security situation of the Republic but only about the 
domain of the interior minister. We have not yet received an 
overall report, which should be prepared by the interior and the 
defense ministers and BIS [Security Information Service] 
director. 
  [Spurny] What do you believe to be the most critical 
security risks for the Czech Republic? 
  [Suman] I will start with the greatest ones. First, it is 
the development in Russia, where anything can happen. Militant 
nationalism is another danger. If it is proved in former 
Yugoslavia that aggression pays, it will serve as a clear sign 
for other countries in which this nationalism has so far been 
expressed in only a milder form. Organized crime also 
represents a genuine threat. This applies also to internal risks. 
  At home, I see the danger in expressions of racism, in the 
emergence of extremist movements, and, of course, in the 
development of crime, although it is no longer rising as fast as 
in previous years. [passage omitted] 
  [Spurny] Why has the acting head of BIS, Stanislav Devaty, 
not been appointed to the post? 
  [Suman] During the coalition talks, it was agreed which 
party would be given the post of defense minister and that the 
Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] would give up its claim to this 
post in exchange for another appointment. It was mentioned that 
it could be BIS. Internal security is affected by two 
sectors--Interior and BIS. The ODA and the Christian and 
Democratic Union [KDU] consider it very problematic for a single 
political party to control both these sectors. It is difficult 
for me to speak about it, however, because I was also mentioned 
as a possible candidate for the job. 
  [Spurny] The post of [Interior] Minister Ruml is also 
frequently questioned. Recently, it is particularly the social 
democrats who have focused on this post. 
  [Suman] Before tackling this question, let me explain that, 
although Ruml and I are not friends, our mutual relations have 
always been very courteous. Regarding the demands for his 
recall, I have already explained it once to Mr. Zeman [CSSD 
chairman, who has called for Ruml to be recalled]. The Social 
Democrats [CSSD] speak only about the adverse development of the 
crime rate. I believe the opposition should come up with new 
concepts so the voter can choose from several alternatives. I 
suspect that the conduct of the left wing is purely 
purpose-oriented because the minister is considered a symbol of 
the struggle against the Bolsheviks. That is why the opposition 
is after his head. Jan Ruml is a very impulsive person, who 
sometimes acts in a mercurial way, but, at this time, I do not 
know a single person who would be able to do the job of interior 
minister substantially better than he. 
  [Spurny] What do you think about developments in the Czech 
Army? 
  [Suman] No changes, and personnel changes, in particular, 
affected the Army before the beginning of 1993. Even last 
year's screening did not solve this problem because it, as I 
also believe, fell short of its objective. The assessment was 
often done by people with a very questionable past. 
  I imagined that several of the least untrustworthy officials 
at the highest level would be chosen. These commanders were to 
appoint their subordinates, and, if they chose wrongly, they 
would bear full responsibility. 
  [Spurny] As an economist, Prime Minister Klaus allegedly 
does not attribute such importance to security issues as they 
deserve. 
  [Suman] I do not know the prime minister well enough. I can 
only speak about his opinion concerning the intelligence 
services. I know that it was not easy to convince him of the 
importance of intelligence services. He advocated an 
integration of espionage and counterespionage in both the 
civilian and the military services. For me, a model that could 
lead to a threat to democracy is completely inadmissible. It 
testifies to a not very thorough knowledge of intelligence work. 
A characteristic feature of his personality may have played a 
role here: He came to a certain conclusion and was convinced 
that it was the correct one because it was his opinion. 
  [Spurny] The case of the bugging of Justice Minister Novak 
has not been clarified. What was the reason for the failure? 
  [Suman] The several hours immediately following the 
discovery of the bugs testify to the failure of our professional 
services. This applies, however, only if it was not intentional, 
which I do not expect. [passage omitted]
