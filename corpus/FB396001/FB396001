protest Fujimori fujimori fujimori continuing Fujimori earlier signs that Beijing would reward France for its 
accommodating stance on Taiwan arms sales by expanding Sino- 
French aviation cooperation, Beijing has recently announced 
contracts with the French-based European consortium Airbus 
Industrie (Xinhua, 4,6 March).  According to a Xinhua report of 6 
March, Airbus has reached an agreement worth "tens of millions of 
U.S. dollars" with China Aviation Supplies Corporation for 
production of aircraft parts in a move that reportedly will 
"increase Airbus' share in the potentially huge China market." 
Xinhua also reported on 4 March that Chinese airlines have 
recently announced plans to purchase nine aircraft from Airbus 
(Xinhua, March 4).  Following the restoration of bilateral ties 
in January, and a French pledge to reverse France's previous 
policy of selling arms to Taiwan, China awarded a major subway 
contract to a French firm.  Beijing had previously shunned French 
companies to protest a November 1992 French decision to sell 
Mirage jet fighters to Taiwan.
